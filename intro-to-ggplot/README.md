# Introduction to ggplot2

ggplot2 is a fantastic data visualization package for the R programming language. This repository is intended as a gentle introduction to the library, with the hopes of giving others the tools they need to produce charts for publications and research presentations.

In order to get started with ggplot2, we'll need to discuss chart design and the role that data types play in the design of a chart.
