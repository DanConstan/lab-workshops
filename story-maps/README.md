# Story Maps

Story Maps is a free, open-source platform for combining texts, images, and videos alongside maps (though technically, maps aren't required!). In this workshop, we'll discuss the pros and cons of the various templates, offering tips along the way for how you might collect, analyze, and visualize your data that will serve as the basis for your Story Map.

## First exercise: Pizza Beyond New Haven
In preparation for creating a Story Map tour, we're asking for your help to gather data on pizza places outside of New Haven. Do you favor New York style pizza? Add your favorite place to our spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cyvfWfeoQ4vXeTkcvkFHRUCpQSik5lBgJK39MFkeeKY/edit?usp=sharing). Include the name of the place under the "name" column, along with a brief description about why you selected that place (maybe they have the best deep dish in Chicago?). 

### To find latitude and longitude
1. Enter the name of your pizza place in [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps)
2. Right click on the location and select "What's Here?"![](https://github.com/YaleDHLab/lab-workshops/raw/master/story-maps/images/latlong_googlemaps.png) The box that appears will contain the latitude and longitude. 
2.5 Altneratively, if you look at the URL, you will find the latitude and longitude has been there all along! ![](https://github.com/YaleDHLab/lab-workshops/raw/master/story-maps/images/url_googlemaps.png)
3. Add the latitude and longitude to the corresponding columns in the spreadsheet

### To find photos for the spreadsheet
1. Go to [Google images](https://images.google.com/)
2. Search for a related photo of your choosing
3. Under "Tools," click "Labeled for Reuse" (more on this later in the workshop) ![](https://github.com/YaleDHLab/lab-workshops/raw/master/story-maps/images/google_images_reuse.png)
4. Right-click on an image in the results and click "Copy Image Location"
5. Paste the image location into columns "E" and "F" in the spreadsheet

Columns "G" and "H" can be ignored.

## Story Maps templates

Story Maps offers a number of templates that you can choose from. Some will be better if you have a lot of textual data, whereas others work especially well if you have geographic data or high-quality visual content. Each template also provides a different user experience. Is chronology important to your argument? If yes, you might choose a template that requires users to scroll through your Story Map, rather than one that gives users the flexibility to jump around to different sections. 

### Spy Glass template
[The World in 1812 and 2013](https://story.maps.arcgis.com/apps/StorytellingSwipe/index.html?appid=b8ece5952db443858442f122984602ba&webmap=8ea34ba9a4f843e08a468595d8d91188#) - generates a conversation about what a comparison of maps can tell us about geographic knowledge at different times in history

### Map Journal template
[Aeneid](http://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=33be151cbe1942d99a300da085884729)- great example for how you can move through a timeline that's synced up with a map - you could easily replace any of the photos in the left-hand bar with videos, if desired

### Cascade template
[The Uprooted](http://storymaps.esri.com/stories/2016/the-uprooted/index.html) - demonstrates the range of media your site might include

[Restoring Old Havana](http://storymaps.esri.com/stories/2017/havana-restoration/index.html?language=english) - demonstrates that you could have the site set up in different languages   

### Crowdsourcing template
[Tropical Storm Harvey](https://napsg.maps.arcgis.com/apps/StoryMapCrowdsource/index.html?appid=b6ef838e4d26489e8f62102639dc3d91) - example of how you can crowdsource photographs in real time

[1Frame4Nature](https://conservationphotographers.org/1f4n/) - example of how you can embed a Story Map within your own site

## Example Map Journal: New Haven Pizza
Let's create a Story Map using the Map Journal template that showcases New Haven pizza. Gathering content is the hardest part of creating a Story Map. For the purposes of this workshop, we'll provide sample data. For after this workshop, here are a few places you might go to collect and map data.

#### Places you might go to collect data
[Connecticut Open Data](https://data.ct.gov/) - many states have complementary sites

[Reference USA](http://search.library.yale.edu/databases/12540702) - good for finding business data

#### Tool for mapping data
Log in to [ArcGIS.com](http://www.arcgis.com/home/index.html) (see instructions in "Getting Started" section below) and go to "Map." Drag a .csv spreadsheet that has a "latitude" and "longitude" column over the map. Voila!   

### Add content to Map Journal
