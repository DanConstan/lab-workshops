## Templates

Story Maps offers a number of templates that you can choose from. Some will be better if you have a lot of textual data, whereas others work especially well if you have geographic data or high-quality visual content. Each template also provides a different user experience. Is chronology important to your argument? If yes, you might choose a template that requires users to scroll through your Story Map, rather than one that gives users the flexibility to jump around to different sections. 

### Spy Glass template
[The World in 1812 and 2013](https://story.maps.arcgis.com/apps/StorytellingSwipe/index.html?appid=b8ece5952db443858442f122984602ba&webmap=8ea34ba9a4f843e08a468595d8d91188#) - generates a conversation about what a comparison of maps can tell us about geographic knowledge at different times in history

### Map Journal template
